# ðŸ”§ v0.0.5 â€“ Structural Refactor & Logging Upgrade
#
# â€¢ Replaced legacy print/debug statements with centralized logging.
# â€¢ Migrated schema field metadata to Pydantic v2+ conventions using json_schema_extra.
# â€¢ Fully cleaned and validated all schema test cases with accurate Gradio-compatible metadata.
# â€¢ Removed deprecated routes, placeholder tests, and unused fakes.
# â€¢ Added robust file/console logging configuration in logging_config.py.
# â€¢ Converted health check and test runner into proper modular test files.
# â€¢ Ensured clean test pass: 8 passed, 1 skipped, 0 warnings (excluding external deprecations).
# â€¢ Final prep before integration with actual ik_llama.cpp backend.
