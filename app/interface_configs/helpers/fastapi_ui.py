Helper functions for the FastAPI UI (Swagger/OpenAPI interface).

This module provides interface-specific logic for modifying or extending
the behavior of dynamically generated FastAPI routes. It is part of the
constructor system and may apply UI-specific schema overrides, descriptions,
or metadata adjustments.

Currently a stub â€” implemented here for future expansion.
